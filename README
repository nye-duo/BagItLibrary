BagIt Library for StudentWeb & Duo-DSpace
=========================================

Introduction
------------
This library enables the packaging of files and metadata from StudentWeb into Bags and the unpackaging of these Bags for
 use in Duo-DSpace.

The Bags have the following structure:

<base directory>/
 |   bagit.txt
 |   manifest-md5.txt
 |   tagmanifest-md5.txt
 \--- data/
       \--- final
             |   [final version files]
       \--- supporting
             |   [supporting files]
       \--- licence/
             |   licence.txt
       \--- metadata/
             |   metadata.xml
 \--- tagfiles/
       |   supporting.access.txt
       |   formats.txt
       |   final.sequence.txt
       |   supporting.sequence.txt

Build/Install
-------------

This library depends on the Library of Congress BagIt Library version 4.1 which is not currently availablein the Maven
central repository.  It can be downloaded from:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/loc-xferutils/files/loc-bil-java-library/4.1/bagit-4.1-src.zip/download

Once downloaded it should be compiled with:

	mvn clean package

and then installed into the local maven repository with

	mvn install

Once this is done, then it's possible to compile this library with "mvn clean package" too.

Creating Bags
-------------

A BagIt object can be created by passing it an existing bag using BagIt(File file) where the file could be the bag zip
file or a bag directory (non-serialised). A BagIt object can be built up using the library as follows:

Bag newBag = new BagIt();

and then adding all the final files using addFinalFile(File file, int sequence) and the supporting files using
addSupportingFile(File file, int sequence, String access).

Once all the files have been added, the manifests and tagfiles are then created with setManifestsAndTagfiles(). This
completes the bag and creates all the necessary files.
