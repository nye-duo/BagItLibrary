BagIt Library for StudentWeb & Duo-DSpace
=========================================

Introduction
------------
This library enables the packaging of files and metadata from StudentWeb into Bags and the unpackaging of these Bags for use in Duo-DSpace.

The Bags have the following structure:

<base directory>/
 |   bagit.txt
 |   manifest-md5.txt
 |   tagmanifest-md5.txt
 \--- data/
       \--- final
             |   [final version files]
       \--- supporting
             |   [supporting files]
       \--- licence/
             |   licence.txt
       \--- metadata/
             |   metadata.xml
 \--- tagfiles/
       |   supporting.access.txt
       |   formats.txt
       |   final.sequence.txt
       |   supporting.sequence.txt

Build/Install
-------------

This library depends on the Library of Congress BagIt Library version 4.1 which is not currently available
in the Maven central repository.  It can be downloaded from:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/loc-xferutils/files/loc-bil-java-library/4.1/bagit-4.1-src.zip/download

Once downloaded it should be compiled with:

	mvn clean package

and then installed into the local maven repository with

	mvn install

Once this is done, then it's possible to compile this library with "mvn clean package" too.
